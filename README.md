# c-haiku

A cute use of the preprocessor to have this C program:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "haiku.h"

    now know summer comes
    let us welcome fresh long days
    too soon the sun sets

output this haiku:

    soon let the sun rise
    long nights be banished from us
    know now winter ends

Originally inspired by Xavier Leroy's [California Codin'](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/stuff/california-prog.html) and the UCSD CSE haiku craze of 2010.
